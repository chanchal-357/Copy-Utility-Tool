# Copy-Utility-Tool

  This is called as Copy Utility. We usually keep our day to day task in some text files or in sticky notes. If required we have to search for these files or sticky which becomes clumsy some times if number of notes increases and this is time consuming. This utility will minimise these day to day tasks and will keep all your notes under some categories which you can access with a simple click. “Also you don’t have to memorize anything, not even a password.”

#### Requirement

  You should have Java 1.6 or higher installed and added in your system path. To check if java is installed and added in your path open command prompt and type "java -version" (without quotes)
  
#### How to use it

1. Download the jar file according to compatible java version, I have added files compaitable with java 1.6 and java 1.7 (or above), copy that file in some location say "D" drive.

2. If java is added in your path you can directly double click and open the application.

3. Go to File in the menu and click category, now create a new category say "Links" and close the window

4. Now goto File and click fields, now select from category dropdown you will find "Links" which you created in step 3. Now under that category add Fields. Give field name and field value.

5. Now go to main window and select the category, a new window will pop up will all the fields you added under selected category.
